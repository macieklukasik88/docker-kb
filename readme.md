# Docker Knowledgebase

## Getting started

We've created a few Bubbles (Markdown documents) to get you started.

- [[inbox]] - a place to write down quick notes to be categorized later
- [[getting-started]] - learn how to use your Foam workspace
- [[todo]] - a place to keep track of things to do

In the `docs` directory you can find everything you need to learn the basics of Foam.
